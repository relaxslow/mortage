            <p>
                This project is one of the project of UONA curriculum named DATA523(Big Data Fundamental).This course revealing the essence of big data technology , how it put to use in practice and what we should keep in mind when use it. Big data went to our lives and benefit almost everywhere as a program developper. I want to combine my programming skill with big data. It happened that this is the good place where Javascript could play well at.

                One major application of bigData is to provide a service which let people download and watch it. No matter what website like amazon or facebook, they are simplar in service. The difference is that they provide different content. Amazon provide commodities while facebook provide pictures and videos. All the services has some custom functions like searching and filtering which let the user view the content they are interested.
                In this project, we are going to build a small test webpage and implement the above functions. The content we provide is related to mortgage industry. We'd like to build a real website to download public mortgage data and conduct analysis in respect to the data. We will view the data from two different angles: chronological and geological. We are trying to perform a downloading tool along with the analytical charts and tables to show how the market performed in the past.

            <h3>topdown approach</h3>
            <p>
                topdown approach refer to a methodology of programming. It divide the whole task into small part and implement them seperately. Its goal is avoid code refactoring as much as possible. But each theory has its premise. Topdown approach assume the developer has clear understanding of the functions and its implementations. In practice, especially for the novice like me who have not enough knowledge of the overall structure. In this situation, bottom up seems a good approach. Code refactoring is inevitable because a simple function can't adapt to various situations. So we tidy up the code,abstract common method and package them into high level functions. finally we make it concise and optimized. This process is helpful to learning and let us see the evolution of the code. That approach also called iterative development.
